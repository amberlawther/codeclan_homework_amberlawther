Question 1

Load in the dataset and call it drinks_content, eyeball it by printing it out (first 5 rows, last 5 rows, and then all of the data) and find out the dimensions (number of rows/columns) and variable names.

```{r}
drinks_content <- read_csv("starbucks-menu-nutrition-drinks.csv")
```
```{r}
head(drinks_content)
```

```{r}
tail(drinks_content)
```

```{r}
dim(drinks_content)
```

```{r}
names(drinks_content)
```

Question 2

Calculate some quick summary statistics to check the mean, the variance, and the normality of the Calories variable. Write a quick summary of your initial impressions of the data.

```{r}
select(drinks_content, as.numeric("Calories"))
```

All of the columns are characters, and there is a lot of missing information.
